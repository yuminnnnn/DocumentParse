<section_header_level_1><loc_60><loc_86><loc_274><loc_93>Pre-Digital Era (19th - Early 20th Century)</section_header_level_1>
<text><loc_60><loc_103><loc_427><loc_134>The origins of word processing can be traced back to the invention of the typewriter in the mid-19th century. Patented in 1868 by Christopher Latham Sholes, the typewriter revolutionized written communication by enabling people to produce legible, professional documents more efficiently than handwriting.</text>
<text><loc_60><loc_144><loc_424><loc_175>During this period, the term "word processing" didn't exist, but the typewriter laid the groundwork for future developments. Over time, advancements such as carbon paper (for copies) and the electric typewriter (introduced by IBM in 1935) improved the speed and convenience of document creation.</text>
